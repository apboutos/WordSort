# WordSort v1.0  
by Apostolis Boutos 8/8/2018

WordSort is a small program for sorting in alphabetical order a list of words contained in a text file.

While trying to learn a new language or improve my skills on an existing one, I often came in contact with words that
were unknown to me. After googling their translation I would write the word down on a text file and once a week I would
revision all the words in the file to see if I still remember their translation and to refresh my memory on the ones 
I did not. After a while trying to find a specific word in the file became very hard because the words were not sorted,
thus I decided to create this program to fix that problem and also sharpen my C skills a bit.

Using the program is pretty straight forward. You drag and drop the file you want sorted inside the WordSort.exe and it is
done. Before sorting the words and altering your file, WordSort will create a backup file just in case something goes wrong, 
as it would be very frustrating to lose a file containing thousands of words. Each word must be on separate line in order
for the program to properly register and sort it. For example a potential input text file should have the following form

avocado</br>
bannana</br>
zero</br>
perk</br>
dead</br>
car</br>
